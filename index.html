    === PRODUCTION-READY GOOGLE MAPS SETUP CHECKLIST (LOCAL DEVELOPMENT) ===
    ================================================================================
    To run this application locally, you must complete the following two steps.
    This is the secure and standard way to handle API keys.

    --- STEP 1: CREATE YOUR .env FILE ---
    1. In the main project folder (the same folder as this index.html file),
       create a new file named exactly: .env
    2. Open the .env file and add the following line, replacing the key with
       the one from your Google Cloud Console.
    
       VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyCNkeZTHvkzH9LgL9hEFr9chFrDQzYTog

    --- STEP 2: CONFIGURE YOUR GOOGLE CLOUD PROJECT ---
    The "This page can't load Google Maps correctly" error is a configuration
    issue in your Google Cloud account. To fix it, you MUST do the following:

    1. ENABLE BILLING:
       - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
       - Make sure your "CHARITY DRIVE" project is linked to an active billing account.
         This is required by Google, even for the free tier.

    2. ENABLE THE 3 REQUIRED APIs:
       - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library
       - Search for and ENABLE each of these APIs one by one:
         - Maps JavaScript API
         - Routes API
         - Places API

    3. REMOVE KEY RESTRICTIONS (for local testing):
       - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
       - Click on the name of your API key.
       - Under "Application restrictions", select "None" and save.

    --- STEP 3: RESTART YOUR SERVER ---
    After creating/changing your .env file, you MUST stop your dev server
    (Ctrl+C in PowerShell) and restart it with `npm run dev`.
